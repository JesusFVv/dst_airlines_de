# Instructions to launch services

- postgresql + dbeaver
- postgrest
- airflow
- nginx
- superset (better than metabase)

## TODO

- Refactoring the launch of docker continers in a single docker-compose file. (for postgresql, dbeaver, postgrest and nginx)
- Airflow and Superset containers should be launched separately. (because of size and complexity)
